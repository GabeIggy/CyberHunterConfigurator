# CyberHunterConfigurator
A web-based tool to apply configurations to NetEase's videogame, Cyber Hunter.

## Reasoning
The PC version of Cyber Hunter is considered subpar and some options are either missing and/or do not work as intended. This tool is intended to fix that and to help newer players to find their correct sensitivity setting, at least this was the original intent of the configurator, until I decided to add support to Graphic Options to make it more understandable for new players.

## How is the sensitivity calculated?
The game uses a "percentage" meter that's is not standard. The best way you can find your perfect sensitivity is converting it from another game. [This website](https://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/) may help you to find the correct value.

## Is it safe to use?
As long you do not use the unsupported options you should be safe. Modifying the .ini file to access the "hidden" options may be considered cheating according to NetEase but nobody in the community has been banned so far. Still, I won't take responsibility if anything happens.

## Is this considered cheating?
This does not alter the game process nor it injects into memory to give you an unfair advantage, so in most games this wouldn't be considered cheating, but you know, NetEase. Refer to the previous point.
